STEPS
-----

 1. Render a quad
    - Create vertices
    - Create Vertex Array / Vertex Buffer / Element Buffer Objects
    - Create quad shader
    - Render!

 2. Render a voxel (cube)
    - Create 6 quads offset and rotated from a center point 
    - Apply texture from atlas
        - Voxel faces have id that corresponds to offset in atlas
    - Render!

 3. Create a 'chunk' of voxels
    - Define chunk size and fill in with voxels 
    - Do not render hidden faces (for each voxel check if faces are open air)
    - Render
    - Load and unload chunks as player moves

 4. Implement basic collision physics
    - Player should be able to stand on ground and not walk through walls

 5. World gen
